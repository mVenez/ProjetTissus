==== WHAT IS THIS? ====
This C++ program simulates the movement in 3D space of tissues, modelized by groups of masses connected by springs.
The simulation is both numerical and graphical, thanks to the Qt OpenGL module.

==== HOW TO COMPILE ====
Inside the project main directory [faut insérer le nom de la directory], execute "qmake" and then "make" commands.
Qmake will generate the necessary Makefile and Make will then build all executables.

==== DURING GRAPHIC SIMULATION ====
Hold Left Click and move the mouse (or use the arrows and QE keys) to look around, and the Home key (or 0) to reset to default view.
Move in the 3D space using WASD (on the xy plane) and RF (z axis).
Press Space to pause the simulation.
